1. Due to bug described here: https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3/issues/3122 , need > 1 missing data. Make sure datasets used in Blang and PyMC3 are matching.

2. Use specific package numbers in pipeline (ie. pymc3 version 12.456)

3. Change Blang and pymc3's nextflow processes to iterate over models individually instead of all models in one process. Ask prof. Bouchard first.
