1. Due to bug described here: https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3/issues/3122 , need > 1 missing data. Make sure datasets used in Blang and PyMC3 are matching.

2. Use specific package numbers in pipeline (ie. pymc3 version 12.456)

3. Change Blang's run.nf process runBlang: iterate over each .bl from input instead of in bash to utilize parallel processing. NOTE: Ask prof. Bouchard first.
